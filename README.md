# SudokuProject
A school project with the goal to create a sudoku game using 7-segment-led's conrolled by a raspberry.
We already gave up on the 7-segment led's and are now using Neopixel leds, because they offer greater functionality, being RGB 
and because it means i don't have to get communication with a f*****g i2c multiplexing chip working. 
(MAX6955 for anyone wondering)

~~Using  mcauser/micropython-mcp23017  https://github.com/mcauser/micropython-mcp23017 (MIT licence~~
not anymore due to abandoning i2c alltogether.
